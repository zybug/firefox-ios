//: Playground - noun: a place where people can play
//: This playground was created to demonstrate the defer keyword and swift 2.0 error handling
//: The motivation was to see if we could replace the Deferred and Result third party dependencies
//: with the native implementations
//:
//: conclusion: no we can't. Swift 2.0's defer keyword is more like a finally block in other languages
//: than like promises which our current Deferred implementation provides

If that scope contains a return block, then the deferred block will be execute _after_ the return.
